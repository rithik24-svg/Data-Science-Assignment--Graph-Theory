# Data-Science-Assignment--Graph-Theory

I have created this repository to store my data science assignment on graph theory, which focuses on the implementation and analysis of the Spectral Bisection method (Newman's algorithm) for community detection, applied to the classic Zachary's Karate Club Graph.
